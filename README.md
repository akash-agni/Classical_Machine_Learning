# Classical_Machine_Learning
Hi!!
This Repository is built to share Intresting projects and analysis done with classical machine learning algorithms.

In the world of Deep Learning it might seem that the relevence of these algorithms might have reduced,
but for simpler and more intutive datasets, they are still very much critical.
Through these projects I wish to learn and also share awarness on the importance of these classical algorithms.
