# Machine_Learning
Hi!!
Building a repository to learn as well as share and preserve my journey of machine learning landscape.
The ideas is to implement what I am learning and create addition tasks to work on.
I will be posting new notebook every week, and will update them as often as I can.
Also with each notebook I will share some addition tasks that I will work on in future, but feel free to fork and attempt those tasks yourself.

Happy Learning Guys!!

## Image Classifier Level 1
Part of Convolutional Learning Project
Python/tensorflow based application for Image classifican tasks.
ResNet50 implemented, trained on 'ImageNet' Data for 1000 clases.
### Upcoming Changes
1. Update to Resnet154

## California_Housing_Price_Prediction.
Part Learning Machine Learning Process, implemented as part of Exercise in chapter 2 of Aurelien Geron's Book.
### Upcoming Changes
1. Build a stacked model, by using multiple algos.
2. Also build a class with API's fit and predict, to accept a list of models and build a stacked model.
3. build a class to  automate the entire training process and update the final model if the improvement is significant.

## Custom Model Building with TensorFlow
Part of Learning to Implement Custom Model components using low level tensorflow api, without using keras.
### Upcoming Changes
1. Build a custom Implementation of tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
2. Define custom optimizer to  implement Nadam function.
3. Define custom loss function for sparse categorical crossentropy calculation
4. Customize the training look using Autodiff
